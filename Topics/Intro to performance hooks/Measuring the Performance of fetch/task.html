<p></p><p>You've defined a function to fetch data. Now, you'll want to see how long this async function <code class="java">fetchData</code> takes to complete its execution. To achieve this, use the <code class="java">PerformanceObserver</code> class. Remember, there's no need to call the <code class="java">fetchData</code> function again; it's already been called for you, with performance entry points marked. You should only log the duration of this performance entry, and make sure it's in milliseconds.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 30 seconds</font><br><br>
